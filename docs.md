# Introduction

This plugin aims to help with git-based releases.
It should be run on every commit of the default branch to execute it's necessary actions.

A Woodpecker workflow file could look like this:

```yaml
steps:
  release-helper:
    image: woodpeckerci/plugin-ready-release-go:0.6.1
    settings:
      release_branch: ${CI_REPO_DEFAULT_BRANCH}
      forge_type: github
      git_email: <email>
      github_token:
        from_secret: GITHUB_TOKEN

when:
  event: push
  branch: ${CI_REPO_DEFAULT_BRANCH}
```

## Features

- Create automated changelog based on PRs which updates itself after each merge to the default branch
- Auto-categorization of PRs based on labels
- Automatically determines the next version
- Supports any kind of programming language, changelog tool and commit style
- Execute custom pre-release hooks

## Overriding Settings

To override the default settings, add a `release-config.ts` file to your repository.

```ts
export default {
  commentOnReleasedPullRequests: false,
};
```

The plugin also supports executing custom prepare hooks before the plugin execution which can e.g. help to perform additional actions during a release (e.g. updating a helm chart's `appVersion` field):

```ts
export default {
  beforePrepare: async ({ exec, nextVersion }) => {
    await exec(`sed -i "s/^version:.*$/version: ${nextVersion}/g" Chart.yaml`);
  }
```
